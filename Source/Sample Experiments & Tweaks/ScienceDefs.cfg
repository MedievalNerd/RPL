	{

		MunInSpace = Flight controls confirm that we have entered Mun's gravitational field.

		GillyInSpace = It looks like a particularly lumpy rock. You bet you could you could jetpack down there.

		MohoInSpace = The planet doesn't appear to have an atmosphere, and you notice darker spots across the surface.

		EveInSpace = You can't help but notice how incredibly purple the planet is. The shiny oceans are mesmerizing.

		DunaInSpace = The planet is very red, and appears to have deep brown furrows across the surface. There does appear to be some kind of ice at both poles though.

		IkeInSpace = You can't help but like Ike.
		IkeInSpace = There appears to be some steep rocky slopes. The higher areas are lighter in color and the lowlands appear to be very dark gray.

		DresInSpace = Looking down you see a massive canyon on the surface. It could be several kilometers deep.
		DresInSpace = The surface has a patchwork of white and brown areas, with a few craters.

		JoolInSpace = You watch the flowing green storms below, they seem to go on forever endlessly swirling into eachother.
		JoolInSpace = This planet is a wholesome green color, you note down that more planets should be this color.

		LaytheInSpace = Laythe looks a lot like Kerbin, you wonder what would happen if you took your helmet off down there.
		LaytheInSpace = The surface is mostly covered in oceans. You mark down the landmasses in your report.

		VallInSpace = The surface has many impressive and jagged mountain ranges. You don't think you'd like to try and land on them.
		VallInSpace = The moon is mostly white and lighter blue shades. It looks very cold and possibly frozen.

		TyloInSpace = It looks like it would be very hard to land here. It also appears one side is more cratered then the other.
		TyloInSpace = The surface is covered with various shades of white and gray. You think for a second you saw a face down there..

		BopInSpace = It appears to be a large brown rock. Perhaps an old asteroid?
		BopInSpace = As you stare at the planet, something flits by the window.. Is there something moving down there?

		PolInSpace = It looks like a really large grain of pollen. You note down -Pol- in your report.
		PolInSpace = The terrain below looks very hazardous. You make note of the jagged rocks, inclines and other dangerous areas.

		EelooInSpace = The surface appears to be mostly frozen. You see some interesting brown areas peeking out of the ice and note them in your report.
		EelooInSpace = You search the sky for other nearby planets, you think Eeloo must be lonely out here by itself. Maybe we should pay it a visit and cheer it up a bit.
